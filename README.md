# Learning_Python

In this repository, I will be completing all of the exercising in the "Python Crash Course" third edition book. Learning python seems to be essential as the tech world advances. I want to learn Python to the point where I can use this skill to elevate my tech career. Feel free to use this repository for your own Python studies.
