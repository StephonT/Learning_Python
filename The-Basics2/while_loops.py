# while loops are written with the keyword while followed by a condition. As long as the condition is true, the condition will be repeatedly executed. If you do not add line 7, i will be less than 5 forever and the loop will never stop. You'll get an infinite loop. 

# Example:
i = 1
while i <= 5:
    print(i)
    i = i + 1
print("Done")
