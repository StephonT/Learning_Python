# Formatted strings makes it easier to visualize a string. You use the letter "f" followed by quotations and the type out the string of words. The variables have to be in curly braces. Very similar to Javascript

first = "Stephon"
last = "Treadwell"

message = f'{first} [{last}] is a coder!'
print(message)
